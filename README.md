# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Ojective
To build a weather application that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I must use the OpenWeather One Call API to get data from and pass it to the site I am creating through javascript. Local storage will be used to store previous city's searched. Once a city name is typed and the search button is clicked it must retrieve;
the city name,
the date,
an icon representation of weather conditions,
the temperature,
the humidity,
the wind speed,
the UV index,
along with a five day forecast.
